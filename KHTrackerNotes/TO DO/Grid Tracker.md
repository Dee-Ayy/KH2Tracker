- [x] Make buttons change color on click.
	- [x] Ensure that buttons don't share a color flag.

- [ ] Allow Grid Tracker to have a variable amount of rows and columns.
- [ ] Save the current options upon close.
- [ ] Create an OPTIONAL folder that can hold settings for the grid tracker.
- [ ] Create a feature porting list that ports intricate features that were nice from the old tracker to the new one.
- [ ] Create a pop out window that confirms that the win condition has been met.
- [ ] Create a setting that allows user to either clear the card upon close, or keep the previous card intact (in the event of a crash of some sort).
- [x] Create a way to associate each button with a specific check. That way, when that check gets autotracker, we can invoke a button press during AutoTrack.cs.
- [x] Allow for anything that can be tracked to be on the card
- [x] Update Annotated colors in real time.
- [ ] Clean up code conversion between "Color" type and "Brushes" type.
