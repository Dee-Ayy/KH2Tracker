# KH2Tracker
- [ ] Update Broadcast Window references to Grid Tracker.


# Grid Tracker
- [x] Make buttons change color on click.
	- [x] Ensure that buttons don't share a color flag.
- [x] Create Options Window that has game settings, and selected checks based on groups (i.e. boss fight, magic, movement, etc.)
- [ ] Allow Grid Tracker to have a variable amount of rows and columns.
- [ ] Save the current options upon close.
- [ ] Create an OPTIONAL folder that can hold settings for the grid tracker.
- [ ] Create a feature porting list that ports intricate features that were nice from the old tracker to the new one.
- [ ] Create a pop out window that confirms that the win condition has been met.

# Options Window
- [ ] Make the elements in the dropdown menu span the heigh of the options window.
- [ ] Create option in drives to allow final form tracking as L&D.


# Logic
- [ ] Port Battleship Function to GridTracker
- [ ] Ensure the GridTracker has access to all found checks just like the KH2Tracker.
	- [ ] Ensure the grid tracker has access to boss enemy replacements once seed is loaded in (should they exist).
- [ ] Ensure hints get displayed on the grid tracker if they exist.
- [ ] Check if a bingo has been achieved. (NOT ONLY FOR SQUARE BOARDS)


# Assets
- [ ] Create a json file of all trackable checks.
- [ ] Create a script that populates this json file.
	- [ ] MAYBE: Add a check type attribute to every object that gets tracked.
- [ ] Create separate checks/images for AS, Org XIII, and Data Fights (for hitlist for example).
